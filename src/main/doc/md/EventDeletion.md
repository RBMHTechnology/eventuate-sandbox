### Event deletion

Event deletion distinguishes logical deletion from physical deletion as explained in [Deleting events](http://rbmhtechnology.github.io/eventuate/reference/event-log.html#deleting-events). Event deletion is always performed **up to** a given position in a local event log. For physical deletion, a _deletion version vector_ (`DVV`) must be introduced. It is the least upper bound of the vector timestamps of all physically deleted events. There is one `DVV` per local event log. The `DVV` of an event log `A` always causally precedes or is equal to that event log's current version vector (`CVV`, see also _Storage order_) i.e. `DVV-A → CVV-A` or `DVV-A = CVV-A`. 

Events may be deleted from a local event log `A` only if for all local event logs `i` that are directly connected to `A` the following condition holds after deletion: `DVV-A → CVV-i` or `DVV-A = CVV-i`. In other words, all events that should be physically deleted from a log `A` must have already been replicated to all directly connected logs `i`. This does not only ensure that all events are replicated to directly connected event logs but also prevents the replication anomaly described in _Cyclic replication networks and event deletion_ (see _Appendix_).
